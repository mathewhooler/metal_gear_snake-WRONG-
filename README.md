# Metal-Gear-Snake

## Description

Metal Gear Snake is my take on the classic snake game that so many might remember from their old Nokia Phones.
I have put a twist on the look of the game inspired by one of my all time favourite Playstation games "Metal Gear Solid".

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Getting Started: 
The game operates with the simple use of the arrow keys on your keyboard to direct the snake around the board.


## Planned Future Enhancements.
For future version of the game I would like to implement a change in the snake movement so that the Snake will be able to pass through the game walls and appear on the opposite side of the wall it goes through.
I also would add different difficulty level where the speed of the snake varies.
